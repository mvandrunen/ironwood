# Item Philosophy

Items in **Ironwood Crossing** exist to **change how you move, speak, and choose**—not to inflate power.

## Non‑Negotiable Rules

1. **No pure upgrades.**  
   If an item only makes numbers bigger (damage, HP, speed) without opening a new approach, it does not belong.

2. **Items unlock approaches, not dominance.**  
   Items may enable: a shortcut, a dialogue proof, a non-dominant combat option, or access to a safer route. They should not trivialize danger.

3. **Scarcity is thematic.**  
   Items are rare, deliberate, and usually singular. No loot showers; no grind loops.

4. **Grounded material culture only.**  
   Everything must plausibly exist in the 1800s Texas frontier: paper, rope, tools, food, stamped stubs, ledgers, etc. No magical properties, no mythic framing.

5. **Earned through environment or people.**  
   Items come from: a place that makes sense, a handoff that reflects trust, or a consequence of restraint/endurance. Avoid “random drops.”

6. **Readable impact, minimal UI.**  
   The game should communicate item gain and usefulness through short messages and world reactivity (routes opening, dialogue changing), not new screens.

## Design Intent

- Items are part of **return pressure**, **restraint tests**, and **access gating**.
- If an item does not reinforce return, restraint, endurance, or access, it should be cut.
