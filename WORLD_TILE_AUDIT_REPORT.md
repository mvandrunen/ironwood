# World Tile Audit Report (v1.15.7 baseline)

This build adds an **initial visible normalization pass** (paths/spines) for Ironwood Town + Ironwood Junction.
Full fence/lot authoring is pending a dedicated fence atlas (not present in current tilesets).

## Key enforcement changes (v1.16.0)
- Ironwood Town: authored **primary spine + spurs** using tile=2 (path autotile).
- Ironwood Junction: authored **clear cross-spine** using tile=2 (path autotile) to communicate regulated flow.
